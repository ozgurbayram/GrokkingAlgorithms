## CHAPTER 1
## I will learn fundemental algorithms such as binary search,buuble short etc.
## Then i will learn BigO notation to analyze speed of algorithms

## CHAPTER 2 
## In this chapter i will learn most used data structers arrays and linked lists

## CHAPTER 3
## This chapter will cover recursion technique that can be useful for many algorithm

## Rest chapters will cover specific algorithms and problem solving techniques
